# ActiveReadingReplication
Replication of Meta's Active Reading fine-tuning approach for improving factual recall in small language models. Trains different models on synthetically generated study-strategy data from the facebook/meta-active-reading dataset and evaluates on closed-book factual accuracy on SimpleWikiQA using OpenAI's SimpleQA greading protocol.
